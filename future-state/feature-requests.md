## FR-001: Add "Beautify" button to XML toolbar

**Requested:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Proposed
**Priority:** TBD
**Impact:** TBD

### Description

Add a "Beautify" (format/pretty-print) button to the Monaco XML source editor toolbar. When clicked, it should reformat the raw DITA XML with consistent indentation, line breaks, and attribute alignment without altering the semantic content.

### Value Proposition (Maya Chen, UX Advisor)

Writers working in the XML source pane encounter inconsistently formatted markup constantly — pasted content from Heretto, hand-edited sections, content injected via conkeyrefs or sync operations. The cognitive cost of parsing poorly formatted XML is real: mismatched nesting becomes harder to spot, attribute-heavy elements blur into walls of text, and even experienced DITA authors lose time re-reading structure that clean indentation would make obvious at a glance.

A single-click Beautify action directly addresses this. It removes a repetitive manual task (selecting all, copying to an external formatter, pasting back) and keeps the author inside their editing flow. For a split-pane editor like DITA Architect — where the XML source is always visible alongside the WYSIWYG view — source readability is not a convenience feature; it is a primary interface quality. If the right pane is hard to read, half the editor's value is diminished.

This also has a downstream quality benefit: well-formatted XML surfaces structural errors faster. A misplaced `</entry>` or unclosed `<li>` is far easier to catch in properly indented source than in a compressed block. For a team producing API reference documentation with deeply nested tables (like the Altitude content reviewed today), this is especially relevant.

The interaction should be low-friction: a toolbar icon (consistent with the existing Monaco toolbar style), a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Shift+Alt+F, matching VS Code convention), and no confirmation dialog. The formatter should preserve `<codeblock>` and `<pre>` content verbatim, respect `xml:space="preserve"` attributes, and normalize to 2-space indentation to match the project's existing XML style.

## FR-002: Release notes version browser in What's New modal

**Requested:** 2026-03-12
**Status:** Proposed
**Priority:** Low
**Impact:** Low–Medium

### Description

The What's New modal currently displays only the latest release notes entry (`RELEASE_NOTES[0]`). As more versions ship, users lose access to past entries unless they read the source code. Add a version selector or scrollable list so users can browse release notes from any version.

### Suggested Approach

- Add a version list or dropdown to the left side of the modal, populated from the `RELEASE_NOTES` array in `constants/version.ts`.
- Default selection remains the latest version.
- Selecting a past version renders that entry's sections in the existing right-side layout.
- No backend changes needed — the `RELEASE_NOTES` array already contains all entries.

### Value Proposition (Maya Chen, UX Advisor)

Right now with two versions this isn't urgent, but every release adds another entry that becomes invisible. A version browser turns the modal from a one-time notification into a lightweight changelog — useful for users returning after multiple updates, onboarding new team members, or simply answering "when did we add conkeyref chips?" without leaving the app.
