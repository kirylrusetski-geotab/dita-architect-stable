# DITA Architect Backlog

**Last updated:** 2026-03-16

This is the single prioritized backlog for DITA Architect. Every actionable item — bugs, features, integration work, asset extraction — lives here with a clear priority, dependency chain, and execution criteria.

---

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocks users or breaks core functionality now | Fix in next working session |
| **P1** | Degrades the editing experience or blocks a planned workflow | Fix before next feature work |
| **P2** | Improves quality or enables future work | Schedule in next available cycle |
| **P3** | Nice-to-have, no urgency | Pick up opportunistically |

---

## Active Backlog

### P0 — Fix Now

No open P0 items.

---

### P1 — Before Next Feature Work

No open P1 items.

> P1-8 through P1-11 have all shipped (v0.6.0–v0.7.2). See Completed section for details.

---

### P2 — Next Cycle

| ID | Item | Type | Rationale |
|----|------|------|-----------|
| P2-6 | [Inline validation hints in visual editor](feature-requests.md#fr-004-inline-validation-hints-in-the-visual-editor) | Feature | Authors can write entire topics with broken cross-references and not know until build time. Red underlines on dead `xref`, yellow squiggles on unresolved keyrefs — brings validation into the authoring moment. High impact but substantial implementation. |
| P2-18 | Investigate save confirmation feedback loop | Investigation | After clicking `Heretto > Save` or `Commit`, the status bar stays on `Unsaved changes` with no toast, progress indicator, or success/failure message. Needs investigation: is the PUT firing and succeeding silently (status indicator bug), or is the save not triggering at all (functional bug)? Either way, the UI should show `Saving...` → `Saved and verified` or an error. Found during Maya Chen authoring session (2026-03-13). |

> P2-1 through P2-5, P2-7 through P2-17 have all shipped (v0.6.0–v0.7.2). See Completed section for details.

**Dependency chain:** P2-18 needs investigation to determine if it's a status indicator bug or a functional save bug. P2-6 is the only substantial feature item.

---

### P3 — Opportunistic

| ID | Item | Type | Rationale |
|----|------|------|-----------|
| P3-1 | [Extract AI diff-review workflow from V1](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | ⚠️ **AI-dependent.** High-value pattern but requires new AI integration infrastructure. Not needed for current workflows. |
| P3-2 | [Extract geminiService.ts from V3](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | ⚠️ **AI-dependent.** Good prompt engineering reference. Useful when AI features are on the roadmap. |
| P3-3 | [Extract ConversionWizard from V3](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | ⚠️ **AI-dependent.** Guided migration for new users. Valuable but no user demand yet. |
| P3-4 | [Extract ChatSidebar pattern from V3](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | ⚠️ **AI-dependent.** AI chat with inline proposals. Design is sound, needs full rewrite. |

> **Note on AI features (P3-1 through P3-4):** These items require an API key to an LLM provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). We do not currently have access to one and there is no timeline for obtaining one. **Approach:** If feasible, build the backend integration with the LLM abstraction in place and gate the frontend features behind a key-availability check — they remain hidden until a key is configured. Otherwise, defer these items to a future roadmap when LLM access is available.
| P3-5 | [Extract ditaUtils.ts from V3](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | XML parser/serializer reference. Fix regex bug at line 188 before any use. |
| P3-6 | [Extract DownloadWarningModal from V1](acquisition-evaluation-dita-doer.md) | Extraction | 51-line validation gate. Trivial to port when export flow is built. |
| P3-7 | Geotab theme session action items | Polish | Theme descriptions, tooltip font size, screen reader testing, visual verification. See `.claude/session-2026-03-10-geotab-theme.md`. |
| P3-8 | [Release notes version browser in What's New modal](feature-requests.md#fr-002-release-notes-version-browser-in-whats-new-modal) | Feature | Modal currently shows only the latest entry. A version selector turns it from a one-time notification into a lightweight changelog. Low urgency — only two versions exist today. |
| P3-9 | [Keyboard shortcut cheat sheet](feature-requests.md#fr-005-keyboard-shortcut-cheat-sheet) | Feature | Good shortcuts exist but are undiscoverable without reading source. Overlay triggered by `?` or `Cmd+/`, grouped by category. Small surface, signals respect for keyboard-driven workflows. |
| P3-10 | [Rename `Commit` to `Save to Heretto`](feature-requests.md#fr-015-rename-commit-button-to-save-to-heretto) | Polish | UX review (Maya Chen): `Commit` is Git vocabulary that doesn't match a writer's mental model. Unify with `Save to Heretto` across status bar and Heretto dropdown. |
| P3-11 | [Use writer-friendly vocabulary in status bar](feature-requests.md#fr-016-use-writer-friendly-vocabulary-in-heretto-status-bar) | Polish | UX review (Maya Chen): Status bar terms like `Unsaved changes` + `Commit` and `Conflict` are developer-centric. Rephrase for technical writers. |

---

## Recommended Execution Order

**Session N (next):** P2-18 (investigate save feedback loop). Determine root cause — is save firing silently or not firing at all? Then fix accordingly.

**Session N+1:** P2-6 (Inline validation hints). High impact but needs design thought — which validation rules to surface first, how to source xref/keyref resolution data. Worth scoping before committing.

**Ongoing:** P3 items are picked up when the relevant feature area is being worked on (e.g., extract DownloadWarningModal when building export, version browser when a third release ships). **P3-1 through P3-4 are blocked** on LLM API key access — no timeline; defer to future roadmap unless key becomes available.

## Completed

### Shipped in v0.7.2 (2026-03-16)

| Former ID | Item | Type | Resolution |
|-----------|------|------|------------|
| P1-9 | Word/character count shows zeros on initial load | Bug | Defensive try-catch error boundaries in `BottomToolbar.tsx` around editor state reads. Immediate state read in `useEffect` catches content parsed before listener attached. |
| P1-10 | XML→visual sync blocked during conflict state | Bug | Removed redundant `pending === lastXmlRef.current` condition in `SyncManager.tsx` that prevented Ctrl+Enter sync during Heretto conflict state. |
| P1-11 | Format XML button floats outside XML toolbar | Bug | Moved Format button from absolute-positioned overlay in `MonacoDitaEditor.tsx` into the XML toolbar row in `dita-architect.tsx`. Restyled to match existing toolbar button pattern. |

Dynamic aria-label on syntax theme: `"Select syntax theme: {theme}"`. Keyboard shortcut in format tooltip: `"Format XML (Shift+Alt+F)"`. |
| P2-15 | Improve HerettoReplaceModal recovery text | Polish | Changed to `"To recover, use Heretto's version history (topic → History tab)."` in HerettoReplaceModal.tsx. |
| P2-16 | Improve DiffViewer empty state copy | Polish | Changed to `"No changes detected — your content matches the version in Heretto"` in DiffViewer.tsx. |
| P2-17 | Use contextual placeholder in HerettoStatusModal | Polish | Changed email placeholder from `"user@example.com"` to `"your.name@company.com"` in HerettoStatusModal.tsx. |

### Pre-backlog (v0.5.0 and earlier)

Features shipped before the backlog was formalized. Added retroactively for traceability.

| Item | Type | Resolution |
|------|------|------------|
| DITA-aware auto-completion in XML editor | Feature | Context-sensitive element suggestions via `registerCompletionItemProvider` in `MonacoDitaEditor.tsx`. Walks tag stack to determine parent element, suggests only valid DITA children from a full `ditaContentModel`. Triggered on `<` or Ctrl+Space. |
| Auto-close XML tags | Feature | `setupAutoCloseTags` in `MonacoDitaEditor.tsx`. Inserts matching closing tag on `>` keystroke and positions cursor between open/close pair. Skips self-closing tags, closing tags, comments, PIs, and DOCTYPE declarations. |
| Clickable error panel (jump-to-line) | Feature | Code Status Footer in `dita-architect.tsx`. Problems panel shows XML errors as clickable buttons that call `monacoApiRef.current.revealLine()` to jump to the offending line. |
| Import integrity check (double-fetch verification) | Feature | `ImportVerificationModal` + `useHerettoCms`. Topic content is fetched twice from Heretto and compared before opening. Flags unrecognized DITA elements that won't render in the visual editor. |
| Processing instruction round-trip preservation | Feature | Heretto review markers (`<?ezd-review-start?>` / `<?ezd-review-end?>`) are filtered from Lexical rendering but preserved and round-tripped in the XML output. |
